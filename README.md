Sentiment Analysis <br>
This project demonstrates sentiment analysis using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The notebook (sentiment_.ipynb) walks through data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation for classifying text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.<br>

Features<br>
Text cleaning and preprocessing<br>
Feature extraction (Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, or embeddings)<br>
Model training and evaluation (Naive Bayes)<br>
Visualization of sentiment distribution and performance metrics<br>
Example predictions on custom text<br>

Notes <br>
You can replace the dataset with your own text data.<br>
Some steps may require downloading NLTK resources (stopwords, tokenizers, etc.).<br>
